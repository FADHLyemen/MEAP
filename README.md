# MEAPis is a new algorithm MeaP (Metabolite enzyme association Predictor), which predicts the potential associations between 
metabolites and enzymes in metabolomics data. MeaP uses the enzyme-metabolite interaction data from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) reaction database and the protein-protein interaction data from STRING database.

It used  panda function implemented in PandaR R package.
